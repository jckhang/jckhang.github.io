#Approaching NYC No-Cabs-At-4PM Problem through Taxi Data

No-Cabs-At-4PM is an age-old NYC problem. Itâ€™s some time after 4PM and you step out to look for a cab. You giggle as you watch a tourist repeatedly try and hail cabs with the off-duty lights on, but then you realize the joke is on you too. Most of the cabs have off-duty lights on. Better luck next time. Social Data Scientist, Ben Wellington tries to using taxi data to prove this myth and finding out how to fix this problem.
