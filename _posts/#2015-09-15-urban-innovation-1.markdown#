#Approaching NYC No-Cabs-At-4PM Problem through Taxi Data

No-Cabs-At-4PM is an age-old NYC problem. It’s some time after 4PM and you step out to look for a cab. You giggle as you watch a tourist repeatedly try and hail cabs with the off-duty lights on, but then you realize the joke is on you too. Most of the cabs have off-duty lights on. Better luck next time. Social Data Scientist, Ben Wellington tries to using taxi data to prove this myth and finding out how to fix this problem. <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>

Now, Ben Wellington want to look inside the NYC Taxi Revenue data and try to find out and fix the problem. at the data from 2013 collected by Chris Wang.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> Ben uses the 2013 NYC Tax Trip Open Data FOILed (aka Freedom of Information Law) by Chris Whong. He plotted the trip data and found a dreaded decrease in average revenue per minutes during 2:50PM and 6:10 PM, and reaches a low point at 4:30 PM. See </div>
